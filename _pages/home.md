## About me

I am a PhD candidate in applied mathematics at Northwestern University, working under the advising of <a href="https://www.madhavmani.com/" target="_blank">Professor Madhav Mani</a>. I am broadly interested in high performance scientific computing. My current research happens to be in the field of developmental biology, and involves inferring the timecourse of chemical signals from gene expression data in developmental systems. I hold a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, with a concentration in teaching.

In my spare time I enjoy playing chess, piano, and judo. I also have two cats, <a href="/cats/" target="_blank">Cicero and Figaro</a>.
