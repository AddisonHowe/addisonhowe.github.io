## About me

I am a PhD candidate in applied mathematics at Northwestern University, working under the advising of <a href="https://www.madhavmani.com/" target="_blank">Professor Madhav Mani</a>. I am broadly interested in high performance scientific computing and applications to quantitative biology. My current research uses dynamical systems theory and tools of machine learning to construct landscape models of cellular differentiation. I hold a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, with a concentration in teaching.

In my spare time I enjoy playing chess, piano, and judo. I also have two cats, <a href="/cats/" target="_blank">Cicero and Figaro</a>.
