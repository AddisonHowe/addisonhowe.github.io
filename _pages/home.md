## About me

I am a PhD candidate in applied mathematics at Northwestern University, working under the advising of <a href="https://www.madhavmani.com/" target="_blank">Professor Madhav Mani</a>.\\
I hold a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley. My current research involves inferring chemical signals from gene expression data in developmental systems. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing chess, piano, and judo. I also have two cats, <a href="/cats/" target="_blank">Cicero and Figaro</a>.
